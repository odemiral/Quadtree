QuadTree
======================
Fast C++11 implementation of Quadtrees. It's still a work in progress, I'll write a detailed README when I'm done. 

Currently supports 

1. Insertion

2. Deletion

3. Search

4. Update

Dependency
------------
Developed on Windows using Visual Studio 2013 but it should compile with any C++ compiler with C++11 support.

Usage
-----------
Please check the main.cpp for test usage.


Upcoming changes
-------------------
1. Performance optimization for update() function
2. Implementing getPossibleCollisions function (returns all the nodes in same quadrant)
3. OpenGL visualization
